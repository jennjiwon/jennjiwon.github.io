In Summer 2018, we met weekly as a research/study group to investigate: **what makes the BTS phenomenon so unique, paying particular attention to how they utilize transmedia storytelling strategies to build an ever-expanding world around them for the fans to enjoy.** We watched every single BTS music video, dug through the depths of Twitter, and even went to their concerts to find out (who said academia has to be boring?).
