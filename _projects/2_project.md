I assisted with the research, translation and editing/proofreading of an [edited volume](https://snuac.snu.ac.kr/eng/index.php/2021/03/25/transnational-convergence-of-east-asian-pop-culture/) project, published by Routledge in March 2021. I also managed the budget, administrative duties, and communication between contributors.
