Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the [Institute of Communications Research](https://media.illinois.edu/icr) at the University of Illinois, interested in studying 'technology, Asian technocultures, and globalization.' My current projects delve into AI ethics, the spread of information across Asian diasporic communities, and the emergence of and resistance to Western tech forces in East Asian spaces. I am engaged in critical examinations of historical and contemporary narratives, thinking about the repercussions of colonialism, capitalism, and liberal humanism, with a particular focus on how these forces shape and are shaped by technocultural advancements in East Asia.

Previously, I have studied Korean popular culture and fandoms, and have conducted research with industry giants such as Netflix and HYBE. I have an M.A. in Communication from Seoul National University, and a B.S. in Media, Culture, and Communication, _magna cum laude_, from NYU.

I love to travel whenever I can. I was born and raised in Seoul, but I have also spent a good chunk of my life in New Jersey, Manhattan, and Orlando.
