Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring scholar in communication and media studies. My research interests lie at the intersection of `digital culture & identity`, with an emphasis on **globalization, fan studies, participatory culture, and social activism.** In particular, I am interested in the individual and communal identity-building processes of historically marginalized groups within emerging media landscapes such as social media and the metaverse.

Currently, I am working as an Administrative Assistant at the [Department of Communication](http://communication.snu.ac.kr/en) at Seoul National University.

I earned an M.A. in Communication from Seoul National University, and a B.S. in Media, Culture, and Communication (_magna cum laude_) from New York University.

In my spare time, I like to travel, go on runs, and geek out over Disney, K-pop, and musical theatre. I was born and raised in Seoul, but also call New Jersey, New York, and Orlando second homes.
