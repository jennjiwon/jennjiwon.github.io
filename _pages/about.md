Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring scholar in communication and media studies, with research interests located at the intersection of `digital culture & identity` in relation to  `globalization, fan studies, and social activism.` In particular, I am interested in the individual and communal identity-building processes of historically marginalized groups within emerging media landscapes like social media and the metaverse.

I earned an M.A. in Communication from Seoul National University, and a B.S. in Media, Culture, and Communication (_magna cum laude_) from New York University.

In my spare time, I like to travel, go on runs, and geek out over Disney, K-pop, and musical theatre. I was born and raised in Seoul, but also spent a good chunk of my life in New Jersey, Manhattan, and Orlando.
