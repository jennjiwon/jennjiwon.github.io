Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am an aspiring scholar in communication and media studies, with research interests located at the intersection of `digital culture and identity` in relation to globalization, fan studies, and social activism. In particular, I am interested in the individual and communal identity-building processes of historically marginalized groups within emerging media landscapes like social media and the metaverse.

I earned an M.A. in Communication from Seoul National University, and a B.S. in Media, Culture, and Communication, _magna cum laude_, from NYU.

In my spare time, I like to travel, go on runs, and geek out over K-pop, Disney, and musical theatre. I was born and raised in Seoul, but I have also spent a good chunk of my life in New Jersey, Manhattan, and Orlando.
