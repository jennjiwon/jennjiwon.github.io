Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring scholar in communication and media studies, with research interests located at the intersection of `digital culture and identity` in relation to globalization, youth culture, and social activism.

I currently work at the [Dept. of Communication](http://communication.snu.ac.kr/en) at SNU. Previously, I was the Editorial Assistant at [Journal of Communication Research](https://www.dbpia.co.kr/journal/publicationDetail?publicationId=PLCT00001667). 

I have an M.A. in Communication from Seoul National University, and a B.S. in Media, Culture, and Communication, _magna cum laude_, from NYU.

In my spare time, I like to travel, go on runs, and geek out over K-pop, Disney, and musical theatre. I was born and raised in Seoul, but I have also spent a good chunk of my life in New Jersey, Manhattan, and Orlando.
