Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am an incoming PhD student at the [Institute of Communications Research](https://media.illinois.edu/icr) at the University of Illinois, with research interests located at the intersection of `digital culture and identity` in relation to globalization, youth culture, and technology.

Previously, I have studied Korean popular culture and fandoms, and have conducted research with industry giants such as Netflix and HYBE.

I have an M.A. in Communication from Seoul National University, and a B.S. in Media, Culture, and Communication, _magna cum laude_, from NYU.

In my spare time, I like to travel, go on runs, and geek out over K-pop, Disney, and musical theatre. I was born and raised in Seoul, but I have also spent a good chunk of my life in New Jersey, Manhattan, and Orlando.
