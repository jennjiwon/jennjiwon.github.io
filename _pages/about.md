Hi there!

I am a cultural studies scholar and aspiring PhD student in Communication and Media Studies. My research interests lie at the intersection of digital culture and identity, with an emphasis on globalization, participatory culture, and social activism. In particular, I am interested in the identity-building processes of historically marginalized groups within emerging media landscapes such as social media and the metaverse.

Currently, I am working as an Administrative Assistant at the [Department of Communication](http://communication.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University. 

I received a Master of Arts in Communication from Seoul National University, and a Bachelor of Science in Media, Culture, and Communication (_magna cum laude_) from New York University.

Outside of academia, I love to travel, bake (my go-to stress-reliever!), and geek out over Disney and K-pop. Some of my current obsessions include [TikTok](http://vt.tiktok.com/ZSehLkJVY), _Dune_, and [Seong-Jin Cho](https://youtu.be/aNMlq-hOIoc).
