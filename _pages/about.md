Hi there!

I am a cultural studies scholar and aspiring PhD student in Communication and Media Studies. My research interests lie at the intersection of digital culture and identity, with an emphasis on globalization and social activism of historically marginalized groups. 

My Master's thesis explored boundary-policing within the K-pop fandom through the use of cringe videos.

Currently, I am working as an Administrative Assistant at the [Department of Communication](http://communication.snu.ac.kr at Seoul National University. 

I received a Master of Arts in Communication from Seoul National University, and a Bachelor of Science in Media, Culture, and Communication (magna cum laude) from New York University.

Outside of academia, I love to travel, bake (my go-to stress-reliever!), and geek out over Disney and K-pop. Currently obsessed with [TikTok](http://vt.tiktok.com/ZSehLkJVY), Dune, and [Seong-Jin Cho](https://youtu.be/aNMlq-hOIoc).

Feel free to reach me with any questions at ohjiwon@snu.ac.kr.
