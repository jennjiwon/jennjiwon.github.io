Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a cultural studies scholar and aspiring PhD student in Communication and Media Studies. My research interests lie at the intersection of `digital culture and identity`, with an emphasis on globalization, participatory culture, and social activism. In particular, I am interested in the identity-building processes of historically marginalized groups within emerging media landscapes such as social media and the metaverse.

Currently, I am working as an Administrative Assistant at the [Department of Communication](http://communication.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University. 

I earned my MA in Communication from Seoul National University, and my BS in Media, Culture, and Communication (_magna cum laude_) from New York University.

In my spare time, I love to travel and geek out over Disney and K-pop. I also enjoy baking and running. Some of my current obsessions include [TikTok](http://vt.tiktok.com/ZSehLkJVY), _Dune_, and [Seong-Jin Cho](https://youtu.be/aNMlq-hOIoc). I was born in Seoul, raised in New Jersey, with a few dashes of New York and Orlando mixed in.
