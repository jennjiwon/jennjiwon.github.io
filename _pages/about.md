Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a cultural studies scholar and aspiring PhD student in Communication and Media Studies. My research interests lie at the intersection of `digital culture and identity`, with an emphasis on globalization, fan studies, participatory culture, and social activism. In particular, I am interested in the identity-building processes of historically marginalized groups within emerging media landscapes such as social media and the metaverse.

Currently, I am working as an Administrative Assistant at the [Department of Communication](http://communication.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University. 

I earned an M.A. in Communication from Seoul National University, and a B.S. in Media, Culture, and Communication (_magna cum laude_) from New York University.

In my spare time, I like to travel, bake, go on runs, and geek out over Disney and K-pop. I was born in Seoul, raised in New Jersey, with a few dashes of New York and Orlando thrown in.

You can download my CV [here](https://github.com/jennjiwon/jennjiwon.github.io/raw/master/assets/pdf/CV_jiwonjennoh%20(2).pdf).
